# Grid World Temporal Difference Learning

This problem is taken from the book Reinforcement Learning by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (Example 6.5, exercises 6.6, 6.7).

On a rectangular grid, the Grid World, an agent, starting at a given point, has for each discrete time-step a number of moves available to him (e.g., go right one step). At the same time a wind blows cold, pushing him around the grid depending on his position. He must find a way to get to a given node in the grid as fast as possible.
